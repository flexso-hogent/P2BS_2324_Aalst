## About The Project

Get to know the latest SAP technologies and apply them in an application for managing internal events. The main objective of this assignment is for the student/team to become familiar with the latest SAP technologies. To measure progress, this will be implemented in a SAP CAP application for managing events and the various sessions that take place at such an event. Additionally, participants can check which sessions are being organized, register for the sessions they want to attend, and also give a rating to the sessions they attended.
